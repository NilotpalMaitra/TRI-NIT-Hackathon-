# AUTOMATED ROAD DAMAGE DETECTION FOR IMFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE 

- Manual inspection of road conditions is a time-consuming and labor-intensive
task, leading to delays in identifying and repairing damaged roads. The goal is to
develop a classification model capable of automatically detecting and
categorizing road damage from images (captured through CC
cameras,phone,etc.), in order to make the maintenance process efficient. The
infrastructure management is enhanced by reducing the reliance on manual
inspections and enabling timely and targeted repairs to ensure safe and
well-maintained road networks.
